## 2019 Election Analysis and Swing Prediction Model

This project explores voter behavior and key trends in India's 2019 general election, 
focusing on factors that shaped outcomes in different regions. By analyzing data on 
demographics, economic conditions, and social factors, we identify patterns that 
influenced voting across urban and rural areas, caste groups, and regions. The project 
uses basic statistical methods to highlight how issues like regional disparities and 
government policies impacted voter decisions. This analysis aims to provide a clear 
understanding of the complexities of India’s democratic process and offer insights into 
what influences voter behavior in large-scale elections.      
 
With the advent of increased computational power, various new forecasting techniques 
have emerged for a plethora of applications. One such area is the forecasting of 
competitive elections, which are the hallmark of modern democracy, and being able to 
foreshadow who wins the elections is a tantalizing skill that has garnered significant 
scientific attention. Data Analysis would be used to parametrize computations such as 
coalitions and swings on all the seats. After that, Machine Learning algorithms such as 
Linear Regression can be utilized to calculate the aforementioned swing parameters 
using past election data specific to the relevant seats.

**Machine Learning Models**
1.  Linear Regression - for baseline trends.
2.  Support Vector Machines (SVM) - for complex swing patterns.
3.  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) - for capturing non-linear relationships between 
demographic and voter behavior shifts.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

<br> Elections have a crucial role in the functioning of a modern democracy. With a barrage of 
stakeholders at play, it is in the interest of many to have advance knowledge of political 
results. It also helps political parties strategize better and adopt to the public favorability.  
India's 2019 general election witnessed over 600 million voters casting ballots for more 
than 8,500 candidates competing across 543 constituencies, making it one of the largest 
democratic events in history. This immense scale and diversity provide a rich dataset to 
explore the factors influencing electoral success at a granular level. Despite the availability 
of vast data, comprehensive analyses of the characteristics that differentiate successful 
candidates from their peers remain limited. Traditional metrics like party affiliation and 
vote shares offer only a partial view of electoral dynamics, while critical candidate-specific 
factors—such as personal background, political experience, educational qualifications, 
declared assets, criminal records, and campaign narratives—are often underexplored in 
shaping outcomes.
